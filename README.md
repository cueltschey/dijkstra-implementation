# dijkstra-implementation 🎓

### Description 🧾

This is a simple c++ based project that is meant to give me a better understanding of graphs, heaps, and
dijkstra's algorithm. It uses a min-heap to keep track of unvisited nodes. The code for the algorithm is original
and does not come from any outside sources.

### Usage ⚒️
run the following to clone on your machine
> git clone https://github.com/cueltschey/dijkstra-implementation

then run the main cpp function.
the graph is made  using a .txt file (an example is included)
run make to compile using the makefile
