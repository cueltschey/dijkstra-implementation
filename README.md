# dijkstra-implementation 🎓

### Description 🧾

This is a simple c++ based project that is meant to give me a better understanding of graphs, heaps, and
dijkstra's algorithm. It uses a min-heap to keep track of unvisited nodes. The code for the algorithm is original
and does not come from any outside sources.

### Usage ⚒️
run the following to clone on your machine
> git clone https://github.com/cueltschey/dijkstra-implementation

then run the main cpp function.
the graph is generated randomly so that the graph is diffecernt each time. note that there are restrictions on what vertexes can
be linked, based on their number. To change the size of the graph put a different number in the MinHeap constructor.
